# TypeScript Playground

This repo is my TypeScript Playground for learning TypeScript - a seemingly random assortment of files, code snippets and folder structure bits and pieces.

## Structure

### Learning Materials

At this point, there isn't really any structure. For learning materials, I'll take anything I can find on the web.

But among more structured items are

- _Learning TypeScript_ by John Goldberg
- [TotalTypescript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials) by [Matt Pocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)
- Literally **any** episode of SyntaxFM talking about TypeScript

### Documentation & Exercise

Currently I'm doing one of three things:

- read the docs on https://www.typescriptlang.org/
- set up a project (any project!) on VSCode, install TypeScript, start writing JavaScript in a \*.ts file and add types until the red lines are gone!
- migrate old JavaScript code to TypeScript
